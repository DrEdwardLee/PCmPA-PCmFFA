# PCmPA-PCmFFA
In this repository, two types of robust multi-scale anisotropy filtering methods namely PCmPA and PCmFFA, that considering the local contextual information of curvilinear  structures are extracted from phase congruency maps for the effective discrimination of  isotropic structures and curvilinear structures.
