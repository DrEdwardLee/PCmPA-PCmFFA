Paper:

Pavement Crack Detection based on Progressive Curvilinear Structure Anisotropy Filtering and Vision Perceptional Grouping

(paper under review)

In this repository, two types of robust multi-scale anisotropy filtering methods namely PCmPA and PCmFFA, that considering the local contextual information of curvilinear  structures are extracted from phase congruency maps for the effective discrimination of isotropic structures and curvilinear structures.

1.Installation.

a) This released is written for the Matlab interpreter (tested with versions R2017b) and requires the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox. Due to the policy of cooperative enterprises, we cannot release source codes, and encrypted them using ’.p’ files.

b) the following two Toolbox are required:
   The DIPimage toolbox is requred for the path opening/closing operations . It can be downloaded at: http://www.diplib.org/download

2.Getting Started.

Make sure to carefully follow the installation instructions above.

Please see "demo.m" to run demos and get basic usage information.
